1
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:22,643
Private Dawes, report to the OC.

2
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:28,479
Relax, Dawes.

3
00:00:29,647 --> 00:00:31,558
Bit cold out there, isn't it?

4
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,245
Yes, sir, tater's, sir.

5
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:36,086
You'd better go and pack
your sun cream, Dawes.

6
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:38,880
You're off to Afghan
and it's 47 degrees.

7
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:46,558
Battle casualty replacement.

8
00:00:51,367 --> 00:00:54,678
You've done well on your
mission-specific training,

9
00:00:54,727 --> 00:00:57,640
so you've got tonight fo
say goodbye to your family.

10
00:01:08,047 --> 00:01:10,038
It's not going to
be easy, Dawes.

11
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,958
You're serving your country.

12
00:01:19,207 --> 00:01:21,198
Do yourself proud.

13
00:01:27,647 --> 00:01:29,445
Brize Norton, 1100
hours tomorrow.

14
00:01:29,487 --> 00:01:32,035
You're to report to a
Corporal Kinders and be

15
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:34,607
attached to his section,
under Captain James.

16
00:01:36,927 --> 00:01:38,918
First impressions are important.

17
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:42,158
Make the right one.

18
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:44,758
Private Dawes?

19
00:01:45,287 --> 00:01:46,686
Yes, Corporal.

20
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,081
Welcome to the Under Fives.

21
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,801
Right, Dawes, you
are with 2 Section.

22
00:01:57,847 --> 00:01:59,838
Double in and join them.

23
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:18,483
Can it really take you
massive cockwombles

24
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:21,918
this long to get in your sections
for a bloody photograph?

25
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:26,440
What are you laughing at, Medic?

26
00:02:26,487 --> 00:02:27,921
"Cockwomble," sir.

27
00:02:30,727 --> 00:02:33,879
For the benefit of our alleged
new medic, who are we?

28
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:35,918
The Under Fives, sirl

29
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:40,157
And why do you think
we're called that, Medic?

30
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:42,526
I don't know, sir.

31
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:44,160
Well, take a look.

32
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,401
They look young, sir?

33
00:02:49,447 --> 00:02:51,757
And every one of
them is in my charge.

34
00:02:51,807 --> 00:02:54,162
So if you can't cut it as our
medic and part of the team,

35
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,847
I have no hesitation in
lobbing you out of the plane.

36
00:02:56,887 --> 00:02:58,878
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

37
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:02,078

No, I'm not. I'm

Oh, bollocks.

00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:07,364
We were bound to meet again at
some point. That's the army for you.

52
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:09,967
You call me "Round the
back of the Indian takeaway"?

53
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:11,361
Only for shorthand.

54
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:15,526
I was going to text you back but we
weren't allowed phones at Catterick.

55
00:04:15,567 --> 00:04:17,524
You've got something
on your chin.

56
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,558
Oh, it's just a bit of bullshit.

57
00:04:21,487 --> 00:04:23,416
I bet you don't remember
what they call me.

58
00:04:23,428 --> 00:04:24,161
I do, actually.

59
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:26,926
It's on my phone. "Smurf."
Cos you look like one.

60
00:04:27,407 --> 00:04:29,717
No, I don't. I'm
bunk-up material, me.

61
00:04:29,767 --> 00:04:32,122
I could have had any of
your section but I chose you.

62
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,363
Oh, I'm so proud.

63
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:37,286
Listen, don't say anything
to the others, yeah?

64
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:40,476
You're an idiot.

65
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:42,440
You don't want
me to tell the lads?

66
00:04:42,487 --> 00:04:45,525
What happened that night, it was a
one-off. I was pissed out of my nut.

67
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,366
So you don't want
me to tell anyone?

68
00:04:48,407 --> 00:04:51,559
You'd better not. First
impressions and all that.

69
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:55,725
I don't know if I'm comfortable
not telling my comrades the truth.

70
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:59,476
Well, I'm one of your comrades
now, so you'd better not let me down.

71
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:04,566
I'll just say I was on my phase
two, went to Pirbright for the rugby...

72
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:07,281
- met you and some girls and had a laugh.
- Well, it's the truth.

73
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,841
- Behind the takeaway.
- No, don't you dare.

74
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:15,597
Lads, mate of mine...
Cockney... Goon.

75
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,638
but all right.

76
00:05:18,247 --> 00:05:21,080
- Happy?
- Ecstatic, you Welsh wanker.

77
00:05:21,207 --> 00:05:23,562
Oh, ho-ho.

78
00:05:23,607 --> 00:05:25,598
Cheeky.

79
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:49,841
Right, hour outside Bastion.

80
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:52,879
All don your full protective
clothing including helmets.

81
00:06:06,207 --> 00:06:09,006
Look at that. Oh, my God.

82
00:06:10,927 --> 00:06:12,361
They got a Costa Coffee.

83
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:14,557
They ain't even got one
of them in Basildon, Baz.

84
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:19,522
We got two as it happens
because Baz Vegas is paradise!

85
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:20,841
They got a Nando's?

86
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:23,925
They best have a Nando's or I'm
going home. I love Nando's, man.

87
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,322
He wanted to get a Nando's
tattoo when we was on basic!

88
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:29,962
- Don't tell everyone our secrets!
- Sorry, bruv.

89
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:32,203
Look at the size of the sun!

90
00:06:32,247 --> 00:06:34,238
Loads bigger than
the England sun.

91
00:06:34,287 --> 00:06:36,873
I'm going to need more
than factor 50 out here.

92
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:38,599
I'll tell you that for nothing.

93
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:03,517
Left, right, left, right, left.

94
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:06,761
Left, right, left, right, left.

95
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,521
Left, right, left, right, left.

96
00:07:13,247 --> 00:07:15,238
Section, halt!

97
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,958
Right turn!

98
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:24,118
Platoon... platoon, ‘tion!

99
00:07:28,007 --> 00:07:30,601
Welcome to Afghanistan.

100
00:07:30,647 --> 00:07:33,844
You'll be here at Camp Bastion
for a few days" assimilation.

101
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:36,606
And then you are to be
deployed on a mission.

102
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:41,403
You have an excellent captain,
on his fourth tour of Afghanistan.

103
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:45,486
So you will listen and follow
his instructions to the letter.

104
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:53,245
Do well, apply yourselves
and you'll have a good tour.

105
00:07:58,767 --> 00:08:02,597
Mansfield... Beautifull

106
00:08:02,647 --> 00:08:04,479
Well within our price range, eh?

107
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:07,440
I don't know about you, mate.
I booked the presidential suite.

108
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,286
- Now I've got his stinky feet in my face.
- Fellas!

109
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,327
I'm leading a PT
session at 0530.

110
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:19,557
Make sure you hydrate tonight
and first thing in the morning.

111
00:08:19,687 --> 00:08:23,043
Any of you helmets not on
top form and giving me 100%

112
00:08:23,087 --> 00:08:27,320
will get my new regulation combat
boot six-lace-holes up your arses.

113
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:31,160
Best recruit at Catterick,
one pace forward.

114
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:38,321
Now, did you pass
geography at school, Dawes?

115
00:08:38,807 --> 00:08:40,798
- No, sir.
- No.

116
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:42,961
Did you, Smurf?

117
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,236
Oh, yes, sir.

118
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,641
Good.

119
00:08:45,687 --> 00:08:48,998
Then you can show our Doris
where the female quarters are.

120
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:53,604
This...is stags only.

121
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:59,403
- See you later, doc.
- Come on, Dawes. Get your stuff together.

122
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:07,038
You think I can't
manage my own kit?

123
00:09:07,527 --> 00:09:09,518
Just trying to be nice.

124
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,846
"Best recruit at Catterick”.

125
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:14,606
What, the Captain say that to
you every time he talks to you?

126
00:09:14,647 --> 00:09:17,366
He loves me. Everyone loves me.

127
00:09:17,407 --> 00:09:18,727
I'm the life and soul, pal.

128
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,044
Dunno if I can put up with
six months of your bollocks.

129
00:09:22,087 --> 00:09:24,179
Are you that pissed
off the captain likes me?

130
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:26,160
Maybe I don't want
that Rupert to like me.

131
00:09:27,127 --> 00:09:29,118
Find your own quarters.

132
00:09:29,687 --> 00:09:31,041
What?

133
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:33,358
He's a better person
than you'll ever be.

134
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,765
Don't worry about Smurf.

135
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:41,525
Looking for the female quarters?

136
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,558
Come on.

137
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:54,279
- It's a bit bloody hot, innit?
- You'll get used to it.

138
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:00,717
Dump your kit. That
bed's free next to mine.

139
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,322
I'm Molly, by the way.

140
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,880
Jackie.

141
00:10:09,927 --> 00:10:11,600
You've arrived
on a killer hot day.

142
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:13,638
It's like walking
through treacle.

143
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:19,285
So you know Smurf, then?

144
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,556
I knew his twin brother.

145
00:10:20,607 --> 00:10:22,598
He was killed on Herrick 15.

146
00:10:23,807 --> 00:10:27,277
- You're joking?
- James was his Captain too.

147
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,319
That's why Smurf won't
hear a bad word about him.

148
00:10:30,367 --> 00:10:32,358
I just called him a Rupert.

149
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:36,405
Smurf's brother Geraint
got shot in the neck on patrol.

150
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:40,122
James crawled about 200m on his
belly to get him and bring him back.

151
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,363
He weren't leaving him
as a trophy for the Taliban.

152
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:44,683
He'd do the same for you.

153
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,525
Let's hope he don't have to.

154
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:51,798
We'll get something
to eat later.

155
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,477
- They got a Nando's?
- Pizza Hut any good?

156
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:57,278
Gotta be better
than rations, eh?

157
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:01,320
It'll be worth it, trust me.

158
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,200
- Can't we phone up for a delivery?
- You can! Serious.

159
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:06,966
They got this little bloke
that bombs around on a bike.

160
00:11:07,007 --> 00:11:09,283
Be quicker just to
grab one now, though.

161
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:16,638
You don't wanna be eating junk food
before a Captain James PT session!

162
00:11:16,687 --> 00:11:18,360
We're off to the healthy tent.

163
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:21,559
I'll still be running while you're
breathing out of your arse.

164
00:11:21,607 --> 00:11:23,598
Obsessing about my arse again?

165
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,158
Don't ask.

166
00:11:39,327 --> 00:11:42,922
Six injured. MERT's bringing them in
now. All medical personnel to the hospital.

167
00:11:42,967 --> 00:11:44,560
- Come on.
- Me?

168
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,086
You're "medical", aren't you?

169
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,240
Right, let's get him inside.

170
00:11:57,207 --> 00:11:58,845
Molly, get on this stretcher.

171
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:00,878
Molly!

172
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:08,278
Soldier vs. IED.

173
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:11,326
Left below knee missing,
right above, tissue damage.

174
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:13,483
Unstable catastrophic
haemorrhage.

175
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:18,202
Slide.

176
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:19,476
Massive wound to lower back.

177
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:22,360
I need surgical access. Let
me know when that's happened.

178
00:12:22,407 --> 00:12:23,886
We need blood stat.

179
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,438
Still losing blood!

180
00:12:31,927 --> 00:12:34,521
Can we get a pelvic X-ray
and a fast scan, please?

181
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:37,286
- We're clear for chest X-ray.
- Temperature 36.

182
00:12:38,887 --> 00:12:40,366
Come on, focus.
We're losing him!

183
00:12:40,407 --> 00:12:42,398
Sort yourself out.

184
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:05,518
You all right, Moll?

185
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:12,476
I really thought my
training would kick in.

186
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:14,803
It will do. Don't
worry about it.

187
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:18,478
Will he make it? The marine.

188
00:13:19,047 --> 00:13:21,561
Got a better chance
here than anywhere else.

189
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,358
The state of him, Jackie...

190
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:36,318
Get some shut-eye.

191
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:38,167
If only!

192
00:13:39,127 --> 00:13:41,118
[tll be all right.

193
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:53,958
Private Dawes.

194
00:13:56,447 --> 00:13:58,085
Private Dawes.

195
00:14:06,127 --> 00:14:10,803
Well, I suppose we should be
grateful you're not wearing your stilettos.

196
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:12,406
It's full kit, Dawes.

197
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:14,438
Yes, sir.

198
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:21,563
Left, right, left,
right, left, right.

199
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:25,643
One, two, three, four.

200
00:14:26,287 --> 00:14:28,403
Are we all acclimatised
to the conditions?

201
00:14:28,447 --> 00:14:30,085
Sir.

202
00:14:30,127 --> 00:14:32,118
Right, we sprint
the last 50. Gol

203
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,760
Smurf, hit the deck now!

204
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,881
Medic, man down!

205
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:45,965
Left leg blown off below the
knee. What are you going to do?

206
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:49,161
Come on, what
are you going to do?

207
00:14:49,207 --> 00:14:52,962
You're really going to let him bleed out
while you gasp for air like a puffer fish?

208
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:53,837
Come on, Dawes!

209
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:56,318
This isn't Call Of Duty
on the Play Station.

210
00:14:56,487 --> 00:14:59,605
Someone stands on an IED,
there's a life to save. Get it?

211
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:03,721
Come on, what
are you going to do?

212
00:15:04,967 --> 00:15:06,958
Come on, Dawes.

213
00:15:09,007 --> 00:15:10,998
Smurf, get up.

214
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:14,920
- Who are we?
- The Under Fives.

215
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:16,526
- Who are we?
- The Under Fives!

216
00:15:16,927 --> 00:15:19,806
Now get yourselves
showered now. Double away.

217
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:27,438
He could have died just then.

218
00:15:28,247 --> 00:15:32,525
Please don't tell me we've got the only
medic who can't stand the sight of blood.

219
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:49,198
Relax, lads.

220
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,760
We're out of Bastion
in the morning

221
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:53,959
and headed to our special
little Forward Operating Base.

222
00:15:54,247 --> 00:15:56,158
This will be our home
for the immediate.

223
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,432
When we arrive at
the village, we will link

224
00:15:58,444 --> 00:16:00,838
up with a small tally of
Afghan National Army.

225
00:16:00,887 --> 00:16:03,356
Three's a small Taliban
cell destabilising the area.

226
00:16:03,407 --> 00:16:04,477
Lovely.

227
00:16:04,527 --> 00:16:06,518
- Any questions?
- No, sir.

228
00:16:08,287 --> 00:16:12,406
We need the locals to like us
and more importantly to trust us.

229
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:15,198
Nobody let me down.

230
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,307
Right, our task on the
ground is to support,

231
00:16:19,319 --> 00:16:21,564
assist and advise the
Afghan National Army

232
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:23,883
with patrols around the
general area of the FOB

233
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,885
and facilitate the local children's
safe passage to their school.

234
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,487
Sound easy?

235
00:16:28,527 --> 00:16:31,121
Lollipop men with guns.

236
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,886
Then get your head
out of your arse, Dawes.

237
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:36,077
There is no such thing as
an easy mission out here.

238
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:39,119
Right, you'll be flown out in
your sections 0400 tomorrow.

239
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,556
So tonight I need you all
to have seen the medic.

240
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:43,678
It's like speed-dating, Dawes.

241
00:16:43,727 --> 00:16:45,764
One minute each, then
sod them off out of it.

242
00:16:48,607 --> 00:16:50,006
Sit up!

243
00:16:55,487 --> 00:16:57,478
Nice one, Dawes.

244
00:17:02,287 --> 00:17:03,516
Lads, sort yourselves out.

245
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,604
Single file. You're
in your own time now.

246
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,638
Boys!

247
00:17:09,687 --> 00:17:11,678
- Ready, Dawes?
- Yes, Corporal.

248
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:14,838
Right, Nude-Nut, in.

249
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,407
Oh. What's all that about?

250
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:26,122
I cut myself shaving and I know
how much you hate the sight of blood.

251
00:17:29,927 --> 00:17:31,918
Do you feel fit?
Any injuries at all?

252
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:34,721
- You can sit down.
- No, I best not. Fit and well.

253
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:36,886
Shall I send the next person in?

254
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:39,567
- Was there nothing?
- No. See you.

255
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,358
Boys giving you a hard time?

256
00:17:53,727 --> 00:17:55,907
I just feel like I keep
getting off on the

257
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,164
wrong foot. I keep
saying the wrong things.

258
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:01,120
Have you seen the way that
Captain James looks at me?

259
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,318
We're all trying
to prove ourselves.

260
00:18:05,087 --> 00:18:06,885
You'll be fine.

261
00:18:06,927 --> 00:18:08,326
I promise you.

262
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:10,365
I proper froze in that hospital.

263
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,958
You'll be fine.

264
00:18:15,927 --> 00:18:17,918
It takes time and...

265
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:21,723
Sounds like it was a nasty one.

266
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,758
I'm worried that I
won't be able to cut it.

267
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:33,924
We're all worried we
won't be able to cut it.

268
00:18:34,687 --> 00:18:37,201
Anyone who says
they're not is bullshitting.

269
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:42,798
Jackie told me about
your brother, Geraint.

270
00:18:46,527 --> 00:18:51,078
When the Taliban jackpotted him,
James said he heard a cheer go up.

271
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,161
I'm sorry, Smurf.

272
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:57,563
I'm not being...stupid
or nothing, Molls,

273
00:18:57,607 --> 00:19:00,725
but these people,
the Taliban and that,

274
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:03,122
they're not like us.

275
00:19:03,167 --> 00:19:05,158
They're heartless.

276
00:19:08,127 --> 00:19:10,118
You'll be all right, mate.

277
00:19:11,807 --> 00:19:14,196
They laughed as he
lost his life out there.

278
00:19:15,007 --> 00:19:17,283
He lost his life for
our country, Moll.

279
00:19:18,527 --> 00:19:20,518
I don't want him to
have died in vain.

280
00:19:20,607 --> 00:19:22,598
- What does that mean?
- [t means...

281
00:19:25,687 --> 00:19:28,645
I'm going to make
sure he didn't die in vain.

282
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:32,158
You got piles, Smurf?

283
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:35,803
Then you don't need
to sit down, do you?

284
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:53,718
You all right, fella?

285
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:11,078
In case any of you were in
any doubt, this is the real deal.

286
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:18,964
The next six months will
define the rest of our lives.

287
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:25,485
There will be moments on this
tour that you will never forget.

288
00:20:27,407 --> 00:20:30,126
Both good and bad.

289
00:20:33,567 --> 00:20:35,763
It's not about looking
after number one,

290
00:20:36,847 --> 00:20:41,080
it's about looking after numbers
two to 12 in your section.

291
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:45,959
That way you will always have
11 people walching your back.

292
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:49,677
It's why the British
Army can never lose.

293
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:53,163
It is what separates
us from the enemy.

294
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,246
This mission is about
hearts and minds.

295
00:21:02,607 --> 00:21:06,362
We want fo leave this place
in a better state than we find it

296
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:10,238
Stay focused.

297
00:21:11,047 --> 00:21:15,158
Stay alert Stay alive.

298
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:23,203
The day you are less than 100%
focused is the day shit happens.

299
00:21:41,047 --> 00:21:43,038
Hello, you.

300
00:21:45,207 --> 00:21:47,198
Hearts and minds, Dawes.

301
00:21:54,047 --> 00:21:56,482
You don't wanna be
talking to the little bleeders.

302
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:58,518
-Eh?
- Dickers.

303
00:21:58,807 --> 00:22:01,124
Oh, they might look
sweet when they're little

304
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,517
but they all grow up
with one aim, to kill us.

305
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:05,558
I think she was
just being friendly.

306
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,407
Straight back to tell some
insurgent everything about us.

307
00:22:08,447 --> 00:22:10,438
It's their way.

308
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:12,478
Fuel To Fire

309
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:28,325
4 Do you want me on your mind

310
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:34,158
4 Or do you want me to go on?

311
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:42,802
4 I might be yours
as sure as I can say

312
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:48,316
♪ Be gone, be far away

313
00:23:46,727 --> 00:23:48,718
Water, boys.

314
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,598
Throw it over there.

315
00:23:53,327 --> 00:23:55,318
Oh, comedy boys.

316
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:01,478
All right, handsome?

317
00:24:01,527 --> 00:24:03,165
What happened?

318
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:06,598
Someone set fire to your face
and beat it out with a golf shoe?

319
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:14,044
What are you going
to do, shoot me?

320
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,878
0i, oi.

321
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,527
What's all that about?

322
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,127
That $10-Taliban was
giving me the evils.

323
00:24:23,167 --> 00:24:24,646
Behave, will you?

324
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:26,678
He ain't Taliban.
He's one of us.

325
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:44,318
All right, then,
boys. First patrol.

326
00:24:58,727 --> 00:25:02,402
All right, lads, all those years of
training, it's about this moment.

327
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:04,438
Yeah. I hope there's contact.

328
00:25:04,687 --> 00:25:08,157
Come on, let's be having you,
before the sun gets his hat on.

329
00:25:11,487 --> 00:25:13,125
Captain Azizi, let's go.

330
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:24,440
A magazine of 30 rounds. Load.

331
00:26:31,887 --> 00:26:33,116
Hello, girl.

332
00:26:33,167 --> 00:26:35,158
Hello, you.

333
00:26:37,207 --> 00:26:39,198
There you go, little one.

334
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:41,398
You stay?

335
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,279
Pen. Pen.

336
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,758
Pen!

337
00:27:02,727 --> 00:27:04,320
How was that?

338
00:27:04,367 --> 00:27:07,439
Thought there might
be a bit more...action, sir.

339
00:27:08,207 --> 00:27:10,317
Were they watching
us, do you reckon, sir?

340
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:11,438
Without a doubt, Baz.

341
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:14,206
After just one patrol you've
become their ace of spades,

342
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:17,239
the Taliban's most wanted
man after Prince Harry.

343
00:27:17,287 --> 00:27:20,040
My mum always tells
me I look like Prince Harry.

344
00:27:24,527 --> 00:27:27,360
The kids will come up to
you, but don't be distracted.

345
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:30,718
The ones on bikes by the trees to
the west could have been dickers.

346
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:32,758
What were they thinking, Dawes?

347
00:27:37,607 --> 00:27:39,120
That we're at our
most vulnerable.

348
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:40,885
Why?

349
00:27:41,847 --> 00:27:45,044
Well, we're finding our feet,
we don't know the terrain.

350
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:48,278
Right.

351
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:50,318
2 Section going
out again at 1300.

352
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:53,758
Everyone go and get some scoff.

353
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,484
You not hungry, Dawes?

354
00:28:04,527 --> 00:28:07,406
I'm just going to wait for
the ruck to die down, sir.

355
00:28:11,327 --> 00:28:14,396
Sir... Spit it out, Dawes.

356
00:28:14,447 --> 00:28:16,199
Well, it's just...

357
00:28:16,247 --> 00:28:20,798
as a medic, I'm a bit worried that
Smurf's in the right frame of mind.

358
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,080
Why's that?

359
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:26,960
All that with his brother must
have fragged with his head a bit.

360
00:28:27,007 --> 00:28:28,964
Well, he's an excellent soldier.

361
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,998
He knows what he's doing.

362
00:28:31,727 --> 00:28:33,718
It's just that...

363
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:36,478
he seemed a bit...

364
00:28:36,807 --> 00:28:39,037
I dunno, harsh, let's
say, with an ANA bloke.

365
00:28:40,127 --> 00:28:42,243
It's just a bit of early
tour dick-waving.

366
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,278
Always happens.

367
00:28:46,287 --> 00:28:49,245
We're on tour!

368
00:28:50,567 --> 00:28:53,525
Looks like you're
going to take off like ET.

369
00:28:53,567 --> 00:28:55,604
Whoa, speaking of which...

370
00:29:37,367 --> 00:29:38,801
Pen! Pen!

371
00:29:38,847 --> 00:29:40,326
Dawesy!

372
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:43,723
We're all waiting at the gate.
No time to put your face on.

373
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:13,078
Can't see your pen-girl.

374
00:30:13,567 --> 00:30:15,160
I brought some
with, just in case.

375
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:18,438
They can't even read or write, so
God knows why they need pens.

376
00:30:18,487 --> 00:30:20,956
Maybe they wanna
learn to read and write.

377
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:23,802
It's mad how much we
take for granted, isn't it?

378
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:27,598
You're not going to start getting all
profound on me, are you, Dawesy?

379
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:31,561
No matter how cute they are when they're
little, they'll still grow up to hate you.

380
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:33,962
Doesn't have to be like
that. If we're nice to them...

381
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:36,442
- Nice?
- Well, what are you going to be?

382
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:43,278
Contact left! Contact left!

383
00:30:43,327 --> 00:30:44,476
Take cover!

384
00:30:44,527 --> 00:30:45,676
See what I mean, Molls?

385
00:30:45,727 --> 00:30:48,640
Those fuckers have spilt
my family blood out there.

386
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:50,884
Did anyone see
where that came from?

387
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,759
I can't see anything.

388
00:30:52,807 --> 00:30:54,480
Two in the compound
wall behind me.

389
00:30:54,527 --> 00:30:56,518
Keep your heads fucking down.

390
00:30:57,927 --> 00:30:59,998
Think it was from
the compound ahead.

391
00:31:00,047 --> 00:31:02,641
I ain't got a skin what you're
on about. I can't see nothing!

392
00:31:04,087 --> 00:31:06,397
- You sure?
- They are targeting the female.

393
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:09,121
They got eyes on us,
then, so keep down!

394
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:11,124
Come on then, you
mugs, let's have yal

395
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:15,003
Contact 200 metres ahead.
Four shots. Single shooter, sir.

396
00:31:15,047 --> 00:31:16,845
- Have you got eyes on him?
- No, sir.

397
00:31:16,887 --> 00:31:19,606
Interpreter says they're
targeting the female.

398
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:23,556
Get back inside, now!

399
00:31:23,607 --> 00:31:27,999
Right, one at a time,
fucking sprint back into base.

400
00:31:28,047 --> 00:31:30,516
Rest of you, eyes
on that far compound.

401
00:31:31,247 --> 00:31:33,238
First man, go!

402
00:31:36,487 --> 00:31:39,161
They know there's
a female medic here.

403
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:41,287
Move!

404
00:31:41,327 --> 00:31:43,318
- Gol - Moving.

405
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,158
- Move!
- Moving.

406
00:31:55,687 --> 00:31:57,678
Dawes, you're next.

407
00:32:00,527 --> 00:32:02,916
- I can't do it, Smurf.
- Of course you can.

408
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,366
They're after me.

409
00:32:04,407 --> 00:32:06,683
They ain't going to get
you. I'm going to get them.

410
00:32:06,727 --> 00:32:09,367
They see you come out of this
ditch, the wankers will appear.

411
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:11,000
I'll blow their
shitty heads off.

412
00:32:11,047 --> 00:32:12,276
Now get up and run!

413
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:14,716
I can't, Smurf. Just
leave without me.

414
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,486
Dawes, what are you
pissing about at? Go!

415
00:32:18,607 --> 00:32:20,598
Just sorting the med kit!

416
00:32:20,887 --> 00:32:22,366
You've got to go, Molly.

417
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,967
- They'll shoot me.
- No, they won't. I'll shoot them.

418
00:32:25,007 --> 00:32:27,647
I need you guys
out of this ditch now!

419
00:32:27,687 --> 00:32:29,678
Contact ahead! I see the tosser!

420
00:32:29,927 --> 00:32:32,441
What the hell are you
doing, Smurf? Get down now!

421
00:32:32,487 --> 00:32:34,603
Get down, Smurfl Get down!

422
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,437
Now, Molly! Fucking run!

423
00:32:41,487 --> 00:32:43,046
Fucking run!

424
00:33:04,487 --> 00:33:06,683
No-one's coming
out of there tonight.

425
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:09,078
Are you sure you saw something?

426
00:33:09,127 --> 00:33:11,118
I didn't see anything.

427
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,038
It was like Call Of
Duty for a minute, boys.

428
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:19,282
Unbelievable!

429
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:24,276
- I wanna have another go at them, mate!
- Come on!

430
00:33:24,327 --> 00:33:27,285
I haven't seen you run so fast
since Dirty Doreen tried to grope youl

431
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:30,080
- Did you see me run?
- You run a mile before you buy a pint!

432
00:33:30,127 --> 00:33:33,757
I am never ever in my lifetime gonna
be able to work at Foot Locker again.

433
00:33:33,807 --> 00:33:35,002
I am telling you now.

434
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:37,561
Have they got a Foot
Locker in Mansfield?

435
00:33:37,607 --> 00:33:39,598
I'm from Derby, man!

436
00:33:42,967 --> 00:33:44,958
What have we just learnt?

437
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,320
What have we just learnt?!

438
00:33:54,647 --> 00:33:58,117
Every time we step outside this
compound, you need to be totally alert.

439
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:02,958
Medic.

440
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:18,157
I need you to have
a look at my blisters.

441
00:34:18,247 --> 00:34:20,238
Yes, sir.

442
00:34:21,527 --> 00:34:22,592
What do you reckon?

443
00:34:22,604 --> 00:34:24,963
Well, they stink, sir,
with all due respect.

444
00:34:29,287 --> 00:34:33,679
His behaviour when he was unloading his
weapon into that compound was reckless

445
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:34,956
and unprofessional.

446
00:34:35,007 --> 00:34:36,998
Who, sir?

447
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:39,723
Maybe he was "in the
wrong frame of mind".

448
00:34:41,527 --> 00:34:43,518
Sir.

449
00:34:44,327 --> 00:34:46,318
Did you see anyone, Dawes?

450
00:34:48,407 --> 00:34:50,080
He didn't eyeball anyone.

451
00:34:52,207 --> 00:34:54,459
Say there'd been some
children playing inside.

452
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:55,996
It doesn't bear thinking about.

453
00:34:58,527 --> 00:35:00,518
Did you see an insurgent, Dawes?

454
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:05,486
He's a good lad, sir. He's got
a lot of stuff he's dealing with.

455
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:08,838
You don't deal with it whilst
you're carrying a lethal weapon.

456
00:35:08,887 --> 00:35:11,037
He's all right.

457
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:13,078
He just saved my
arse in that ditch.

458
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,005
I knew I didn't need new boots.

459
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:27,444
There was nothing
wrong with my old ones.

460
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:29,478
They'll wear in.

461
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:33,486
Let me dress your blisters and you can
get back to running us round the compound.

462
00:35:35,247 --> 00:35:38,000
- Well, let's see how good a medic you are.
- The nuts, sir.

463
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:55,558
Smurf.

464
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:57,166
A word.

465
00:35:57,207 --> 00:35:59,198
Uh-oh.

466
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:22,278
Right, Fingers...

467
00:36:22,687 --> 00:36:24,678
Oh, yes, sir.

468
00:36:25,847 --> 00:36:28,919
Give that to
Dangleberries, would you?

469
00:36:30,887 --> 00:36:32,241
Dawes, mail.

470
00:36:32,287 --> 00:36:33,561
Come on.

471
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:35,598
- She likes a male, sir.
- Ohl

472
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:38,957
Ow!

473
00:36:39,007 --> 00:36:41,886
I was about to say, "Has anyone
noticed there's no grass in Afghan?"

474
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:44,919
- But I spoke too bloody soon.
- Ohl

475
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:46,958
Boss man. Major Beck on the net.

476
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:50,526
Right, Fingers. You take over.

477
00:36:51,407 --> 00:36:53,125
And no arsing around.

478
00:36:53,167 --> 00:36:55,841
- I am the only one allowed to arse around.
- Sir.

479
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,241
Right...

480
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:12,159
Oh, Baz Vegas.

481
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:17,521
Ooh. Smells like lavender,
bro, and it's a man's handwriting.

482
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:20,480
- Something you not telling us?
- Sump oil, you dick!

483
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:22,837
And it's my dad's handwriting!

484
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:52,239
I know you've told the others
that I'm some sort of dirty old slag.

485
00:37:53,327 --> 00:37:54,920
If the cap fits...

486
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:57,959
Get out. Get out or I
will seriously kill you!

487
00:37:58,007 --> 00:38:00,203
That is a shit
thing to do, Smurf.

488
00:38:00,247 --> 00:38:02,238
Now no-one can even look at me.

489
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,245
You brought it on yourself.

490
00:38:04,287 --> 00:38:06,642
There's only two things
I don't like about you.

491
00:38:06,687 --> 00:38:08,564
Your face.

492
00:38:08,607 --> 00:38:10,883
Going to James and
stabbing me in the back!

493
00:38:10,927 --> 00:38:12,679
It weren't like that.

494
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:14,877
You think I'm mad.

495
00:38:14,927 --> 00:38:16,918
Out of control. A liability!

496
00:38:17,127 --> 00:38:19,562
He called me in and
he sat me down...

497
00:38:19,607 --> 00:38:21,917
Maybe anything I said was
cos I was worried about you.

498
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,607
And I didn't say
anything like that.

499
00:38:24,647 --> 00:38:26,160
But you said something, though.

500
00:38:26,207 --> 00:38:28,039
I saved your arse in
that ditch out there!

501
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:31,159
I know you did. And now you've
gone and ruined my entire tour.

502
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:33,198
Fuck you, Smurf.

503
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:38,118
You already have.

504
00:38:38,167 --> 00:38:40,283
Blue Angel

505
00:38:46,647 --> 00:38:49,480
♪ Blue angel

506
00:38:52,607 --> 00:38:54,564
♪ Blue angel

507
00:38:57,127 --> 00:39:01,519
♪ It's the memory of your warmth

508
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:06,405
♪ That keeps me alive

509
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:11,085
4 When I'm burning

510
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:16,643
4 And my world's closing in

511
00:39:18,167 --> 00:39:22,525
4 Ooh, I'm on fire

512
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:27,241
4 Ooh, I'm on fire

513
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:49,158
As you were, guys.

514
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:51,236
Right, listen in.

515
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:53,119
The proposed ANA
checkpoint will be here.

516
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:56,285
Based in an old compound the Russians
commandeered a few decades ago,

517
00:39:56,327 --> 00:40:00,400
so we'll help Captain Azizi give
it a bit of a Kirstie make-over.

518
00:40:00,447 --> 00:40:01,926
Dried riverbed below

519
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:06,484
and across from the riverbed we have what
intel reliably inform us is a minefield.

520
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,819
They think they're
old Russian mines but

521
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:11,204
nonetheless capable
of blowing your socks off.

522
00:40:12,807 --> 00:40:14,206
Any questions?

523
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:40,718
Is everything all right, Dawes?

524
00:40:41,407 --> 00:40:43,478
They're sending
me to Coventry, sir.

525
00:40:45,847 --> 00:40:47,838
That is worse than Helmand!

526
00:40:48,927 --> 00:40:50,122
Why are they doing that?

527
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:52,158
Cos of what I said
to you about Smurf.

528
00:40:53,727 --> 00:40:56,082
I have to get everyone
through this tour.

529
00:40:56,127 --> 00:40:58,437
That's my job and
nothing else matters.

530
00:40:58,487 --> 00:40:59,886
Yes, sir.

531
00:40:59,927 --> 00:41:02,282
And therefore
I'm grateful to you.

532
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:06,764
Despite what they say, you did the
right thing to tell me your concerns.

533
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:12,037
And for what it's worth,
I think I make you right.

534
00:41:13,087 --> 00:41:15,078
I'm a tad worried too.

535
00:41:17,127 --> 00:41:19,118
Thanks, sir.

536
00:41:20,367 --> 00:41:22,358
Glad to see they're cracking on.

537
00:41:22,407 --> 00:41:24,796
What are they going to do
when we pull out completely?

538
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:26,565
It's not for us to
worry about, Dawes.

539
00:41:26,607 --> 00:41:29,725
We do what we're told till we get
back on that plane to Brize Norton.

540
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:32,281
This whole place
is going to go...

541
00:41:34,487 --> 00:41:36,529
I follow my orders and
I trust those higher in

542
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:38,640
the chain of command
to see the bigger picture.

543
00:41:38,687 --> 00:41:40,200
- Really?
- Absolutely.

544
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:42,602
It's what we have to believe
in and so I believe in it.

545
00:41:42,647 --> 00:41:44,638
I suggest you do the same.

546
00:41:47,327 --> 00:41:49,443
Minefield's to the west
below the riverbed.

547
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:50,966
Be aware.

548
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:46,478
There we go.

549
00:42:47,207 --> 00:42:49,198
What's your name?

550
00:42:50,607 --> 00:42:52,678
How do you say "What's
your name?" in Pashto?

551
00:42:56,647 --> 00:42:59,161
Have I said it wrong?

552
00:43:04,727 --> 00:43:07,037
- What's she saying?
- Her name. Bashira.

553
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:10,004
Ah, Bashira. That's
a lovely name.

554
00:43:10,047 --> 00:43:12,038
I'm Molly.

555
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,440
Molly.

556
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:16,516
Molly.

557
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:18,558
How old are you, Bashira?

558
00:43:23,287 --> 00:43:25,597
-11.
-11?

559
00:43:25,647 --> 00:43:28,082
That's the best
age. Stay 11 for ever!

560
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:31,358
Tell her I've got a sister
who's a similar age in London.

561
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:38,799
Tell her that she can be my
sister while I'm here if she wants.

562
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:02,520
What's that thing they use
in golf, for hitting the ball on?

563
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:04,156
Tee.

564
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:06,881
Milk, two sugars, please.
Thank you very much.

565
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:10,527
I wouldn't mind a cuppa.

566
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:17,396
Relax, lads.

567
00:44:17,447 --> 00:44:19,358
Make sure you're
loaded up on water.

568
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,444
Dehydration's an
absolute bitch out here.

569
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:23,842
Check your piss.

570
00:44:24,087 --> 00:44:26,044
Make sure it's not too yellow.

571
00:44:26,087 --> 00:44:28,966
Fingers, I want you
to set up a kitchen.

572
00:44:29,007 --> 00:44:30,566
Smurf, you're on latrine duties.

573
00:44:30,607 --> 00:44:31,927
- Set up an area.
- Sir.

574
00:44:31,967 --> 00:44:33,685
Well away from
my kitchen, please.

575
00:44:33,727 --> 00:44:36,958
And we need a spot to
burn the silver shit bags.

576
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,236
Nude-Nut.

577
00:44:39,687 --> 00:44:43,123
Dawes, I want you to set up a
treatment facility with an ANA medic.

578
00:44:43,167 --> 00:44:46,478
Captain Azizi, I need you to
clear those kids away right now.

579
00:44:54,087 --> 00:44:56,044
That little wanker is a dicker.

580
00:44:56,087 --> 00:44:57,760
What are you talking about?

581
00:44:58,807 --> 00:45:00,923
No, go on, say
something, I dare you.

582
00:45:00,967 --> 00:45:02,872
All right, I will say
something. That kid is

583
00:45:02,884 --> 00:45:04,801
spotting for the Taliban
and reporting back.

584
00:45:04,847 --> 00:45:06,758
She's just a kid,
Smurf. Chill out.

585
00:45:06,807 --> 00:45:11,040
Yeah, a kid who goes back and
tells the Taliban exactly where we are.

586
00:45:46,647 --> 00:45:48,638
What are you up to?

587
00:46:00,487 --> 00:46:02,867
I guess I'm lucky the
army weren't called in

588
00:46:02,879 --> 00:46:05,163
to make sure I went
to school in East Ham.

589
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:07,081
You didn't go?

590
00:46:07,127 --> 00:46:09,118
Could you tell?

591
00:46:09,607 --> 00:46:12,247
Still, you don't need
GCSEs out here, do you?

592
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:14,643
It's a good job I ain't
got any, then, sir.

593
00:46:16,967 --> 00:46:18,765
Man down! Man down!

594
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:20,760
Man down! Man down!

595
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:22,366
Man down!

596
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:24,159
- What's happened?
- I don't know.

597
00:46:24,207 --> 00:46:26,881
Smurf saw something and
went down the riverbed, sir.

598
00:46:26,927 --> 00:46:28,884
- Across the riverbed?
- Anyone got eyes on?

599
00:46:28,927 --> 00:46:31,521
200 metres. Half
left. Behind the bridge.

600
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:34,719
- That's Smurfl - It's
the bloody minefield!

601
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:36,883
What are you doing
in a bloody minefield?

602
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,123
I've been shot.
I'm pumping blood!

603
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:41,681
Smurf, what direction
was your contact?

604
00:46:41,727 --> 00:46:44,037
- I'm pumping blooa!
- He's got the Vallon with him.

605
00:46:44,087 --> 00:46:45,316
He took it down with him.

606
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,358
He needs a medic!

607
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:52,602
I can get to him, sir. I
know my mine clearing drill.

608
00:46:52,647 --> 00:46:54,365
No fucking way. Wait out.

609
00:46:54,407 --> 00:46:57,206
- Sir, he's losing blood. I can get to him.
- Wait out.

610
00:46:57,247 --> 00:47:00,365
Just because I'm a female, sir,
I don't want special treatment.

611
00:47:00,407 --> 00:47:02,398
I'm the medic, I should go.

612
00:47:02,687 --> 00:47:04,519
I'm pissing blood!

613
00:47:04,567 --> 00:47:06,604
I can't stop it!

614
00:47:07,887 --> 00:47:09,560
Dangleberries,
Brains, with me now.

615
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:13,123
Move. Move, move.

616
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,761
Move.

617
00:47:21,647 --> 00:47:23,240
Eyes out.

618
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:25,278
Let's go, fellas, keep eyes on.

619
00:47:25,527 --> 00:47:27,996
- Has anyone seen the enemy?
- Can't see him.

620
00:47:34,047 --> 00:47:36,118
Molly.

621
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,362
Molly.

622
00:47:37,407 --> 00:47:39,398
Stay calm, Smurf.

623
00:47:39,487 --> 00:47:41,478
Brains! Dangles!

624
00:47:50,287 --> 00:47:52,085
Smurfl

625
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:56,285
Smurfl It's pissing out of me.

626
00:47:56,327 --> 00:47:57,920
Smurf, I'm on my way.

627
00:47:57,967 --> 00:47:59,640
Talk to me.

628
00:47:59,687 --> 00:48:00,882
Alpha 3.0 Bravo. 9 Lino.

629
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:02,918
Roger. So far. Over.

630
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:05,278
Stay calm, Smurf.

631
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:07,365
Where are you hit?

632
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:09,842
Top of the leg. High.

633
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,480
Groin.

634
00:48:11,527 --> 00:48:13,803
Can you get a
tourniquet round it?

635
00:48:13,847 --> 00:48:15,838
I can't get it on. I's too high.

636
00:48:19,207 --> 00:48:20,322
Smurf?

637
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:22,358
Are you all right, Dawes?

638
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:23,522
Talk to me, Smurf.

639
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,286
Nude-Nut, Fingers. Cover
them as they're moving.

640
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:27,920
- Yes, Corporal.
- Yes, Corporal.

641
00:48:27,967 --> 00:48:29,640
You're going to need a winch.

642
00:48:29,687 --> 00:48:33,078
There is nowhere to land. I
repeat, there is nowhere to land.

643
00:48:33,127 --> 00:48:35,562
- She ain't going to make it.
- Yes, she will, Fingers.

644
00:48:35,607 --> 00:48:37,598
We'll make sure of it.

645
00:48:38,247 --> 00:48:41,806
Smurfl Come on, Smurf. Get up.

646
00:48:41,847 --> 00:48:45,038
Smurfl Talk to me, Smurfl

647
00:48:45,927 --> 00:48:48,921
Smurfl Are you all right, Dawes?

648
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,085
Have you got eyes on
Smurf? He's gone quiet.

649
00:48:52,287 --> 00:48:54,483
Talk to her, Smurf.
Talk to her, Smurf.

650
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,006
Come on, Smurf, you tit.

651
00:48:56,047 --> 00:48:58,118
ETA, 30 seconds
on the MERT, sir.

652
00:49:01,167 --> 00:49:02,487
Smurf?

653
00:49:02,527 --> 00:49:04,837
- Smurf?
- Smurf?

654
00:49:04,887 --> 00:49:06,878
- Smurf, - Smurf, come onl

655
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:13,086
Dawes, have you got eyes on
Smurf? Speak to me. How is he?

656
00:49:22,207 --> 00:49:23,845
Dawes!

657
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,839
Dawes!

658
00:49:28,887 --> 00:49:30,560
- Moll?
- Dawes!

659
00:49:31,447 --> 00:49:32,596
Dawes!

660
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:33,796
Molly?

661
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:35,607
Can anyone see her?

662
00:49:35,647 --> 00:49:37,081
I've got eyes on.

663
00:49:37,127 --> 00:49:38,481
She ain't moving, sir.

664
00:49:39,007 --> 00:49:40,998
Contact explosion. Wait out.

665
00:49:44,007 --> 00:49:45,998
Dawes!

666
00:49:46,607 --> 00:49:48,598
Dawes!

667
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:52,526
Dawes!

668
00:49:53,127 --> 00:49:55,118
Dawes, are you all right?

669
00:49:58,327 --> 00:50:00,603
Dawes, talk to me.

670
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:02,445
I'm all right.

671
00:50:02,487 --> 00:50:03,716
I'm all right, sirl

672
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:04,916
She's all right, she's OK!

673
00:50:06,527 --> 00:50:08,200
- Come on, Moll!
- She's all right.

674
00:50:08,247 --> 00:50:10,238
- She's all right.
- Yes, Molly!

675
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:13,443
I can't believe I've
still got my legs.

676
00:50:13,487 --> 00:50:15,524
Just you, Smurf.
Come on lad, come on.

677
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:19,162
- Eyes on, boys, eyes on. Cover her!
- I see her. I see her.

678
00:50:19,727 --> 00:50:21,718
Moll, what's going on?

679
00:50:21,807 --> 00:50:23,798
Smurf?

680
00:50:24,047 --> 00:50:26,038
Smurfl

681
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:28,046
Smurf.

682
00:50:28,087 --> 00:50:29,839
Come on, Smurf. Talk to me.

683
00:50:29,887 --> 00:50:32,322
Smurf, come on. Talk to
me. I've come to save you.

684
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:37,206
Come on, Smurfl
Smurf. Oi, Smurf.

685
00:50:40,327 --> 00:50:42,125
Stay with me. I'm gonna
get you out of here.

686
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:44,477
Please, please don't
die on me, you bell-end.

687
00:50:44,527 --> 00:50:45,722
Dawes, how is he?

688
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:47,644
I need a helicopter.
I'm losing him.

689
00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:51,517
Just stay with me,
Smurf. Keep talking.

690
00:50:51,567 --> 00:50:53,558
Keep making noises for me, yeah?

691
00:50:59,127 --> 00:51:00,561
That's it.

692
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:02,598
That's it, Smurf.

693
00:51:05,167 --> 00:51:08,046
Sir, they can't land here.
It's mined to buggery.

694
00:51:08,087 --> 00:51:09,486
They're gonna drop a winch.

695
00:51:09,527 --> 00:51:11,564
Secure him to the winch
and they'll hoist him up.

696
00:51:11,607 --> 00:51:13,996
I'm gonna have to
go up with him, sir.

697
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:16,206
- Absolutely no way.
- That's it.

698
00:51:17,247 --> 00:51:19,122
There's a sniper.
You'll be a sitting target

699
00:51:19,134 --> 00:51:20,763
dangling on the
end of a fucking rope.

700
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:22,081
No way!

701
00:51:23,407 --> 00:51:25,848
Sir, the tourniquet's
not working. If I take

702
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,481
my fist out of his groin,
he's gonna bleed out.

703
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:31,398
Lucky I got here when I did, eh?

704
00:51:34,327 --> 00:51:35,726
Come on, Smurf.

705
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:38,566
Dawes, do not go up on
that winch. That is an order!

706
00:51:38,607 --> 00:51:40,120
I can't hear a thing, can you?

707
00:51:49,087 --> 00:51:50,316
Am I going to die?

708
00:51:50,367 --> 00:51:52,759
No. If you die, they're
all going to think it's

709
00:51:52,771 --> 00:51:55,123
my fault. That ain't gonna
happen, OK, wanker?

710
00:52:01,487 --> 00:52:03,125
Go on, girl!

711
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:08,602
Dawes, do not go up on
that winch. That is an order!

712
00:52:08,647 --> 00:52:10,604
Do you hear me?

713
00:52:10,647 --> 00:52:11,762
Dawes!

714
00:52:11,807 --> 00:52:13,605
I doubt she can hear
a thing under that.

715
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:16,287
She goes up with him, the
sniper will pop her straight away.

716
00:52:16,327 --> 00:52:18,079
Sitting ducks, guys.

717
00:52:18,687 --> 00:52:23,079
Dawes. What do you think you are doing?
Get off that winch now. That is an order.

718
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:25,721
Dawes!

719
00:52:28,967 --> 00:52:30,958
Oh, fuck.

720
00:52:31,447 --> 00:52:33,358
Go on, Moll.

721
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:36,081
Yes, Molly! Yes, Molly!

722
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:57,200
Come on, Molly!

723
00:52:57,247 --> 00:53:00,922
- 2 Section!
- Molly!

724
00:53:00,967 --> 00:53:04,039
What she just did there
was stupid beyond belief!

725
00:53:04,087 --> 00:53:06,966
She disobeyed a command
and put her life in danger.

726
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:14,119
Fingers, cover them as they're
moving up. Rest of you, eyes on.

727
00:53:14,167 --> 00:53:16,158
It was also fucking awesome.

728
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:51,998
Told you you'd live.

729
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,842
Shit.

730
00:53:54,887 --> 00:53:56,241
What?

731
00:53:56,287 --> 00:53:58,005
I thought it was a dream.

732
00:53:58,047 --> 00:54:00,038
That'll be the morphine.

733
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:05,117
Smurf, what the hell were you
doing in the middle of a minefield?

734
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,158
I saw someone...

735
00:54:07,247 --> 00:54:09,443
I thought they were
planting an IED.

736
00:54:10,887 --> 00:54:12,366
It was that kid of yours.

737
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:14,398
Bashira?

738
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:17,158
I went to take a look.

739
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:20,123
I thought there was
a path that was clear.

740
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:21,805
Yeah, and what happened?

741
00:54:21,847 --> 00:54:25,442
I looked along the path
and right at the other end

742
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:28,081
there was this insurgent
pointing a rifle at my head.

743
00:54:29,927 --> 00:54:31,918
Lucky he was a shit shot, then.

744
00:54:34,327 --> 00:54:35,397
Molls.

745
00:54:35,447 --> 00:54:39,122
Got transport to take you
to the helipad if you're quick.

746
00:54:39,167 --> 00:54:40,885
OK.

747
00:54:41,887 --> 00:54:44,766
Molls, I was a dickhead.

748
00:54:46,207 --> 00:54:48,562
But I'm telling you,
I've learnt a big lesson.

749
00:54:48,607 --> 00:54:50,598
Come here.

750
00:54:55,807 --> 00:54:59,562
I'm going to get myself better
and I'm going to come back to you.

751
00:55:00,687 --> 00:55:02,280
Come back to me?

752
00:55:02,327 --> 00:55:03,840
To the platoon.

753
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:08,481
I'm going to make it up to
you cos I owe you everything.

754
00:55:08,727 --> 00:55:10,718
Yeah, you do, you nut-bar.

755
00:55:13,887 --> 00:55:18,882
I'll never let you down again.
I'll always be there for you.

756
00:55:22,927 --> 00:55:24,918
Let Me Down Gently

757

If you think you're going to win
any plaudits for that foolhardy act,

763
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:03,558
you are 100% mistaken.

764
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:05,838
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

765
00:56:06,687 --> 00:56:10,203
That's what my commanding officer said
to me when I retrieved Smurf's brother.

766

Sir?

767
00:56:13,007 --> 00:56:17,240
Having said that, did you hear me

No, sir.

Thank you, sir.

- I know.

773

I might have slept with
a few people I regret...

774
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,246
We all have.

775
00:56:37,287 --> 00:56:39,278
It's 2014, not 1914.

776

And don't let a bit of name-calling
put you off the task in hand.

781
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:26,518
Captivate You

782
00:57:26,847 --> 00:57:31,000
Heavily armed insurgents are controlling
the area around the mountains and village.

783
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:34,358
Who's done this to your
face, Bashira? Is it your dad?

784
00:57:34,407 --> 00:57:36,523
Something about
her smells a bit rotten.

785
00:57:36,567 --> 00:57:38,717
Do not involve yourself
in the lives of the locals.

786
00:57:38,767 --> 00:57:41,964
They must not become dependant on us
